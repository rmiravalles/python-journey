# We can use for loops to print each item of a list.

colors = ['yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'pink', 'red', 'orange', 'magenta']

for color in colors:  # this means retrieve the first item of the list colors and associate it with a variable called color
    print(color)  # Python will execute this action with every element in the list, in order, until the list ends.

# We can choose any name we want for the temporary variable that will be associated with each value of the list.
