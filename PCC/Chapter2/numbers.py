# There are two types of numbers: integers and floats (or floating points)
# Numbers aren't wrapped around quotes

# Integers are whole numbers without any decimal points
# Floats are simply numbers with decimal points
# We can execute mathematical operations in Python

print("Three plus two equals:", 3 + 2)
print("Five minus two equals:", 5 - 2)
print("Four times three equals:", 4 * 3)
print("Ten divided by two equals:", 10 / 2)  # the result of a division is always a float
print("Three to the power of two equals:", 3 ** 2)
print("The operation below is a modulus, it is represented by %, and it returns the remainder of the division")
print("10 % 2 equals:", 10 % 2)
print("10 % 3 equals:", 10 % 3)
print("10 % 4 equals:", 10 % 4)

# If you mix a float and an integer, the result is a float

# You can assign values to more than one variable in a single line

a, b, c = 10, 20, 30

# Comparison operators

print(a == b)  # == is equals to
print(a != b)  # != (! =) is not equal to

# Even though Python doesn't have a built-in constant type, programmers use all capital letters to indicate
# a variable should be treated as as constant
