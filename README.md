# My Python Journey

**Hi!**

This is the repository where I'll document my learning progress with Python.

## Resources I'm using to study Python

- [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e). In the PCC folder, you'll find the Python files divided by chapters.
- [Practical Python for Beginners](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/practical-python-beginners/table-of-contents) course on Pluralsight. The exercises from this course are in the **Practical_Python_for_Beginners** folder.
